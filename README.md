# oss-client

An open-source, cross-platform game client for SubSpace/Continuum, written in Rust.

- Windows, macOS and Linux (browser later), any resolution, high refresh rates, gamepads.
- Plays on existing zones; feels like Continuum to veterans.
- Reads graphics and sounds from your own Continuum install; ships none.

Status: early development.

## Building

`oss-client` uses the shared crates in [oss-core](https://github.com/DangerMouseUK/oss-core) as a sibling checkout:

```
git clone https://github.com/DangerMouseUK/oss-core
git clone https://github.com/DangerMouseUK/oss-client
cd oss-client
cargo run --release
```

## Licence

GPL-2.0-or-later (see `LICENSE`). The `oss-sim` and `oss-assets` crates are MIT so bots and tools can reuse them.

SubSpace and Continuum are the names of the original games; this project is an independent, compatible implementation and is not affiliated with their authors.
